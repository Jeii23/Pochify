Pocha is a Spanish trick-taking card game derived from Tute and closely related to Oh Hell. Played with a 40-card Spanish deck, the goal is to predict the exact number of tricks you'll win in each round. Accuracy in bidding and strategy is key, as players are penalized for over- or underestimating their tricks. The game progresses with increasing and then decreasing hand sizes, adding an exciting dynamic to the gameplay.
